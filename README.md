# Face-Emotion-Recognition-in-Python-using-CNN
Hii , I'm Hitkar Miglani. 

This is my First High level project. 
I tried to create a CNN using Keras and Tensorflow in Python.

This model basically captures Human Face from live feed using a web camera or by a sample videoa and the predicts the Expression based on the given video.

It has accuracy of about 60%+ in the train and test data set (FER2013)

Thank You

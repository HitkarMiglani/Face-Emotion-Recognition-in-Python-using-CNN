# Face-Emotion-Recognition-in-Python-using-CNN
Hii , I'm Hitkar Miglani. 

This is my First High level project. 
I tried to create a CNN using Keras and Tensorflow in Python.

This model basically captures Human Face from live feed using a web camera or by a sample videoa and the predicts the Expression based on the given video.

It has accuracy of about 70%+ in the train and test data set (FER2013)

Thank You 

## How to Run file:
TO Run the code follow the steps:
  1: install all the requirments from the requirments.txt file
  
  2: Open the realtimedetection.py file and run it from vs code or directly by terminal
  
  3: For sample output run the sample.py file with path to your video
  
  --For Development : you can use the trainmodel.ipynb notebook in jupyter to see the parameters of the CNN model and also suggest any changes for improving the accuracy
